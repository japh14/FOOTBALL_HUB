# ⚽ Teams

Retrieve the list of available teams — limited to the **Top 20 European Football Leagues**.

Data is restricted to a specific season, based on the free tier of [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/).

Each **team ID** is unique within the API and remains consistent across all leagues and cups in which the team participates.

Would you like me to add example API responses or endpoint formats (e.g., request URLs or JSON snippets)? That would make the documentation more developer-friendly.
